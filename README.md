A Hive Helsinki project about installing a virtual machine and the basics of system and network administration.

## Setting up the Virtual Machine

We need a VM with a disk size of 8GB, that has at least one 4.2GB partition.
I set up the VM on VirtualBox with Linux OS, Debian 64-bit with a harddisk size of 8GB.
The `partition method` needs to be set up as `manual` to create the 4.2GB partition.

## Network and Security

__Tasks:__
- Create a non-root user to connect to the machine and work
- Use __sudo__ to be able to perform special rights operations
- Configure it to have a static __IP__ and a __Netmask__ in \30 (we dont want to use DHCP service)
- *SSH* access has to be done with __publickeys__
- Set rules of __firewall__ only with services used outside of VM
- You have to set a __DOS (Denial of Service Attack)__ protection on your open ports of your VM
- Set protection against scans on your VMâ€™s open ports
- Stop services you dont need for this project
- Create __script__ that updates all the sources of package (scheduled task for this script once a week at 4AM and every time the machine reboots)
- Make a script to monitor changes of the /etc/__crontab__ file and sends an email to root if it has been modified (create a scheduled script task every day at midnight)

# 1.
When setting up the machine I created a non-root user. To access sudo with the non-root user we first
need to install the `sudo` command. For this we need to switch to the root by the `su` command.

Then we can install sudo and vim with the command:
```
$ apt-get install sudo vim -y
```
Tog give the non-root user sudo rights we need to add the user to the `/etc/sudoers` file.
`username ALL=(ALL:ALL)` should be added to the *# User priviliege specification* -section. Make sure you have the right access rights to write in the file (`chmod`).

Switch back from root user with `exit`.

Next, we want to configure the machine to have a static IP and a netmask in \30.
In the VirtualBox settings, go to `Network->Attached to` and change from NAT to Bridged Adapter.

Then I edited the file `/etc/network/interfaces` with the primary network interface field like this:
```
#The primary network interface
auto enp0s3
```

After that I created a file called `enp0s3` in the `/etc/network/interfaces.d/` directory.
```
cat /etc/network/interfaces.d/enp0s3
```
```
iface enp0s3 inet static
      address 10.133.133.133
      netmask 255.255.255.252
      gateway 10.11.254.254
```
Then `sudo service networking restart` to make changes effective and then we can check
the ip with `ip addr`. You will see that the ip is the one set in the `/etc/network/interfaces.d/enp0s3` file!

After that we need to set the port we want in the file `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`. The row with Port need to be changed to what you want and made sure that it is not commented out (remove #).

Then
```
$ sudo service sshd restart
```

Now it is time to set up the SSH access with publickeys. First, on the host machine that you want to connect from do:
```
ssh-keygen -t rsa
```
to generate the ssh key pair!
